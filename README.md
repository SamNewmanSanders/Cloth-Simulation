This project was to test if my basic Render engine(if it can be called that?) that I created for the Learning opengl repo could actually be used in another project.

Took about 2-3 hours to implement and learnt a bit about polymorphism implementing the cloth class. The code is quite messy as I didn't plan to go further with this project and just wanted it to work.

Chatgpt helped with cloth physics, wasn't interested in the mechanics

Happy as I have a basis to make these sim projects without hours of setting up boilerplate :)
